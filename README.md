# cvet-editor
a text editor written in java [here's a video of it in action](https://youtu.be/UGMNHPGJ5p4)

note:
old poorly/rushed written text editor thing with opengl it works and is cool but the code is shitty spaghetti. thought id throw it up here!

- very buggy
- mostly a proof of concept, doesn't really function completely as an editor yet
- needs a re-factor
- doesn't use any modern data structures for text editing i.e. a gap buffer/rope/cord (very naively implemented)
- uses immediate mode opengl
